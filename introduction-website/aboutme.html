    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p class="briefIntroduction">I'm studying at Lourdes University playing for the Men's soccer team. Moreover, I'm a
        Junior pursuing my
        Bachelor's degree within the next two years.</p>
    <h2>Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p class="favoriteHobby">My favorite hobby is soccer.</p>
    <img src="Pictures/FC-Bayern_UCL.jpg" alt="Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena before a UEFA Champions League game"
        width="500">
    <p class="favoriteHobby">Moments like these are the ones that make the sport special. My first stadium experience
        was very early in my
        life.
        It immediately got me and I started fully appreciating soccer. This is an actual game I attended in March 2023,
        when Bayern hosted Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League.

    <h3>Confusion</h3>
    <p class="favoriteHobby">When I first came to the country (I was born and raised in Germany), I was a little
        confused with it not beeing called football.</p>
    <h3>How it Began</h3>
    <p class="favoriteHobby"> Anyways, I started playing and loving the sport at the age of 5 and
        nothing since changed.</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Website</h2>
    <p>My favorite website is the website of German soccer club "FC Bayern München".</p>
    <a href="https://fcbayern.com/en">Website - FC Bayern München</a>
    <p>In my opinion it's very intuitive to navigate through the website. Moreover as a fan you get a lot of
        interesting insight. Last but not least, the website very well reflects the colors of the brand
        "FC Bayern München".
